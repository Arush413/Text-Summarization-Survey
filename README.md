This project is an attempt to write a survey paper by me and my team.<br>
We did a study on various text summarization algorithms belonging to different categories. We chose a total of 20 distinct research papers, studied and compared them in this survey paper. We also chose 10 survey papers for our reference.<br>
All the research as well as survey papers, which we chose as reference, are included in the "Reference papers" directory in this repository.<br>
"Survey Paper" file is also included which consists of our study and comparisons of the different techniques for text summarization. We have compared the techniques in the base papers on  basis of the algorithms used, their architectures, advantages and disadvantages as well as the evaluation methodologies.
